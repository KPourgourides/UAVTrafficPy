  abstract = {The new era of sharing information and “big data” has raised our expectations to make mobility more predictable and controllable through a better utilization of data and existing resources. The realization of these opportunities requires going beyond the existing traditional ways of collecting traffic data that are based either on fixed-location sensors or GPS devices with low spatial coverage or penetration rates and significant measurement errors, especially in congested urban areas. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) or simply “drones” have been proposed as a pioneering tool of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) infrastructure due to their unique characteristics, but various challenges have kept these efforts only at a small size. This paper describes the system architecture and preliminary results of a first-of-its-kind experiment, nicknamed pNEUMA, to create the most complete urban dataset to study congestion. A swarm of 10 drones hovering over the central business district of Athens over multiple days to record traffic streams in a congested area of a 1.3 km2 area with more than 100 km-lanes of road network, around 100 busy intersections (signalized or not), many bus stops and close to half a million trajectories. The aim of the experiment is to record traffic streams in a multi-modal congested environment over an urban setting using UAS that can allow the deep investigation of critical traffic phenomena. The pNEUMA experiment develops a prototype system that offers immense opportunities for researchers many of which are beyond the interests and expertise of the authors. This open science initiative creates a unique observatory of traffic congestion, a scale an-order-of-magnitude higher than what was available till now, that researchers from different disciplines around the globe can use to develop and test their own models.}

  ABSTRACT = {The adoption of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in numerous sectors is projected to grow exponentially in the future as technology advances and regulation evolves. One of the promising applications of UAVs is in transportation systems. As the current transportation system is moving towards Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), UAVs will play a significant role in the functioning of ITS. This paper presents a survey on the recent advances of UAVs and their roles in current and future transportation systems. Moreover, the emerging technologies of UAVs in the transportation section and the current research areas are summarized. From the discussion, the challenges and opportunities of integrating UAVs towards future ITS are highlighted. In addition, some of the potential research areas involving UAVs in future ITS are also identified. This study aims to lay a foundation for the development of future intelligent and resilient transportation systems.},

  abstract = {Smart traffic engineering and intelligent transportation services are in increasing demand from governmental authorities to optimize traffic performance and thus reduce energy costs, increase the drivers’ safety and comfort, ensure traffic laws enforcement, and detect traffic violations. In this paper, we address this challenge, and we leverage the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to develop an AI-integrated video analytics framework, called TAU (Traffic Analysis from UAVs), for automated traffic analytics and understanding. Unlike previous works on traffic video analytics, we propose an automated object detection and tracking pipeline from video processing to advanced traffic understanding using high-resolution UAV images. TAU combines six main contributions. First, it proposes a pre-processing algorithm to adapt the high-resolution UAV image as input to the object detector without lowering the resolution. This ensures an excellent detection accuracy from high-quality features, particularly the small size of detected objects from UAV images. Second, it introduces an algorithm for recalibrating the vehicle coordinates to ensure that vehicles are uniquely identified and tracked across the multiple crops of the same frame. Third, it presents a speed calculation algorithm based on accumulating information from successive frames. Fourth, TAU counts the number of vehicles per traffic zone based on the Ray Tracing algorithm. Fifth, TAU has a fully independent algorithm for crossroad arbitration based on the data gathered from the different zones surrounding it. Sixth, TAU introduces a set of algorithms for extracting twenty-four types of insights from the raw data collected. These insights facilitate the traffic understanding using curves, histograms, heatmaps, and animations. The present work presents a valuable added value for academic researchers and transportation engineers to automate the traffic video analytics process and extract useful insights to optimize traffic performance. TAU is a ready-to-use framework for any Transportation Engineer to better understand and manage daily road traffic (video demonstrations are provided here: https://youtu.be/wXJV0H7LviU and here: https://youtu.be/kGv0gmtVEbI).

  abstractNote={&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as effective tools for traffic monitoring and control by offering high-resolution, aerial observations of vehicular movement. Although UAV simulation is well established, tools to capture microscopic traffic measurements from UAV-based observations remain limited. This paper introduces SUMO-UAV-Py, an open-source SUMO plugin that integrates UAV-based sensing into microscopic traffic simulations in Python. SUMO-UAV-Py captures detailed vehicle observations by dynamically employing multiple UAVs to observe traffic measurements based on their position and field-of-view (FoV). Performance evaluations on a mid-sized network demonstrate that SUMO-UAV-Py maintains simulation performance comparable to standard post-processing methods, confirming its suitability for large-scale traffic monitoring research.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},
